# Document Database and Query System

This repository contains a system for building and querying a database of document embeddings, designed to handle document storage, retrieval, and question-answering tasks using the `Chroma` database. The system supports dynamic updates by calculating hashes for document content and provides efficient retrieval through similarity searches using embeddings generated by various models (currently set to use **BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5** from HuggingFace).

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Load PDF documents, split them into manageable chunks, and store them in a Chroma database with corresponding embeddings and metadata.
- **Hash-based Updates**: Efficiently track changes in document content via content hashing and only update changed chunks.
- **Embeddings with HuggingFace**: Leverages the `HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings` for generating document and query embeddings.
- **Query Interface**: A command-line tool to query the database and retrieve relevant document chunks using a similarity search and an LLM-powered response system.
