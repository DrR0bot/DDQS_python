# Document Database and Query System

This repository contains a system for building and querying a database of document embeddings, designed to handle document storage, retrieval, and question-answering tasks using the `Chroma` database. The system supports dynamic updates by calculating hashes for document content and provides efficient retrieval through similarity searches using embeddings generated by various models (currently set to use **BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5** from HuggingFace).

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Load PDF documents, split them into manageable chunks, and store them in a Chroma database with corresponding embeddings and metadata.
- **Hash-based Updates**: Efficiently track changes in document content via content hashing and only update changed chunks.
- **Embeddings with HuggingFace**: Leverages the `HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings` for generating document and query embeddings.
- **Query Interface**: A command-line tool to query the database and retrieve relevant document chunks using a similarity search and an LLM-powered response system.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DrR0bot/DDQS_python.git
   cd DDQS_python

2. **Clone the repository**:
    Install required dependencies: This project uses Python, so ensure you have it installed. Then, install the dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Install PyTorch with CUDA (Optional)**:
    If you want to leverage GPU (CUDA) for faster embedding generation, install PyTorch with CUDA support:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

    For Conda:
    ```bash
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

## Usage
1. **Populate the Database**/n
The populate_database.py script loads documents from a directory, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in the Chroma database. If a document is modified, only the updated chunks will be added or replaced.
